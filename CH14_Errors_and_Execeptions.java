        //for eg - 1. message delivered wrongly - you sent a message to somebody else but it
        // delivered to somebody else
        //2.Wrong time of chats being diplayed - your chat's time are showing wrong
        //3.Incorrect redirects! - you opened link but it directs you too any other browser.

        //Runtime error occurs when the program is running , due to bad input
        // for eg - A user is asked to enter number(int) but he enters name(string) , hence
        //it will be considered as Runtime error
